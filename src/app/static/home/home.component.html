	  <h3>Worried about hidden costs?</h3>
	  <p>Offshore software development offers many benefits but comes
	    with it's own significant challenges.  If you are considering
	    an offshore vendor we can help you avoid common mistakes and
	    ensure you receive predictable results. </p>

	  <h3>Not sure about your requirements?</h3>
	  <p>We can help review your technical solution and make sure
	    your requirements are detailed enough to get the biggest bang
	    for your buck.</p>

	  <h3>Don't have a development process?</h3>
	  <p>We've helped fortune 100 companies develop software
	    development processes that foster offshore development with an
	    eye towards cost effectiveness, conformance to in-house
	    development policy, and easy integration across organizations. </p>

	  <h3>Too many days wasted across timezones?</h3>
	  <p>Let us help you handle the handoff!  The daily handoff is
	    one of the most important aspects of effective offshore
	    development.  Without a standardized efficient handoff even
	    simple tasks can take days to accomplish.</p>

      Playing with Technology
    </h3> 
    <p>
      This site was made by hand using the following technologies
      
      <li>Angular </li>
      <li>Angular Material </li>
      <li>NGXS </li>
      <li>i18N</li>
      <li>Angular Universal </li>
    </p>
    <p>
      The site was pre-generated at transpile time and has been
      optimized using lighthouse.  It uses an appshell to keep initial
      load times fast and lazy loads content after first paint. Custom
      "themeing" and languages are supported out of the box.  To
      access the Playing With Technology page you must pretend to
      login first.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Increate Software we think it is critical to be able to
      communicate effectively with Software Development Professionals
      and undertake a constant stream of spikes to explore new
      technologies. And we think it's fun, which is a bonus!
