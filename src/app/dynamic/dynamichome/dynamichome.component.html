      The site was pre-generated at transpile time and has been
      optimized using lighthouse.  It uses an appshell to keep initial
      load times fast and lazy loads content after first paint. Custom
      "themeing" and languages are supported out of the box.  To
      access the Playing With Technology page you must pretend to
      login first.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Increate Software we think it is critical to be able to
      communicate effectively with Software Development Professionals
      and undertake a constant stream of spikes to explore new
      technologies. And we think it's fun, which is a bonus!
